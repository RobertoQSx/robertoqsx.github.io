Autonomous translator. Casual writer. Avid reader. My native language is Spanish, as I am from Costa Rica, and I have bilingual fluency in English, both spoken and written. You are welcome to peruse my portfolio in this personal website. You can <a href= "mailto:robertoqs@proton.me">email me</a> in order to coordinate conversations via Telegram or Signal, as well as for further collaboration.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word of appreciation for <a href= "https://github.com/divyaranjan1905">Divya Ranjan</a>'s guidance on HTML and for having introduced me to GitHub Pages. This site is <a href= "https://robertoqs.neocities.org/">mirrored</a> in Neocities. The CSS used here is ‘<a href= "https://simplecss.org">Simple.css</a>’, by <a href= "https://kevq.uk">Kev Quirk</a>. Regarding my development in fiction translation, I would like to mention writers <a href= "https://www.geekofalltrades.org/">Forrest Cameranesi</a> and <a href= "https://twitter.com/HerriesAnderton">Herries Anderton</a>, whose respective work I have had the excellent opportunity to bring into Spanish.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My genre literature interests are mostly in the areas of science fiction and fantasy. I also have contact with historical fiction and magical realism. As for academic matters, I am mostly concerned with philosophy and history. Furthermore, I have experience in the medical field (EN<>ES consecutive interpreting background), as well as in information technology (technical writing background, in English).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fertile ground to be cherished: the “leaf-mould of the mind”, in Tolkien's words, the fruits of which I gradually reap across time. My writings originate from short creative burts (whether they be about fictional or non-fictional matters) that I have been progressively producing. The pertinent contents of this website are not listed in accordance to their date of creation. My original work is both in Spanish and in English, depending on topic (with the corresponding translations). Every instance of indulging in imaginative writing is an enriching and enjoyable endeavour.
