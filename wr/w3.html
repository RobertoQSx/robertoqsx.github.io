<summary><b>Pathfinder Memoir: In the Root Garden</b></summary>
<p style="text-align: left">
<br>
Slabs of old stone with moss on it witnessed many a fight,<br>
as nature-ordered green freshness rose skyward in the night.<br>
The land expanded subtly in the same breadth, as if following;<br>
dew drops on leaves on trees told tales of many a wandering.
<br><br>
We traversed small fields where the grass basked in the moonlight,<br>
until we reached an edge of the garden and had to either return or flight,<br>
so we trotted back to the forest proper, risking finding those in hiding:<br>
the stealthy ones who waited and stalked those whose blades were slashing.
<br><br>
There were other types of blades, not of the ones to wield with might,<br>
but instead of the same family as those which we call likewise of grass,<br>
but much larger and morphologically menacing, with surprise to cause fright.<br>
They thus ambushed their prey of a different kingdom, of another living class.
<br><br>
Amidst the dark verdure in the thick of roots and garden there shone a light.<br>
Brilliance was cast as a sunlight phantom recited parts of a known esoteric tale:<br>
a story of great warmth that remade until there were no more wounds in sight,<br>
to then venture deeper into the forest, knowing we were to find more travail.

<summary><b>Pathfinder Memoir: At the Bonfire</b></summary>
<p style="text-align: left">
<br>
When replenishing at the blossoming adored,<br>
full of great warmth and found fragments ored,<br>
many a time the question again came forward:<br>
“Wherefrom hast thou cometh to pathfind and battle,<br>
and to craft associations with metal and mettle?”
<br><br>
To this I answered: “From the green meadow of twilight thistle,<br>
where there reverberate the sweet bagpipe and bass whistle.<br>
Where one rides when under the sunlight and not only on horse,<br>
but also atop a certain joyful type of giant hog of great force.<br>
You would look to the ample horizon, towards the many hills;<br>
you would see tusks navigating over the gleaming mysts of thrills”.
<br><br>
Then in that present past, I said that the Joy of battle I heralded thereby,<br>
as we sat around the bonfire and our souls were replenished whereby,<br>
for us to later leave and march back through the woods' stone doors,<br>
not sure of what we would find that was told of in the mythifying lores.<br>
I donned the ring, for my claymore swings to not easily become chores.

<summary><b>Pathfinder Summoning Mantra</b></summary>
<p style="text-align: left">
<br>
<u>Version I</u>
<br><br>
When a random phantom<br>
and old gods wield clubs,<br>
thence grows a sense of seance.<br>
Writhing of chimes proclaim rhymes,<br>
crafting an association preventing damnation.<br>
The sunlight phantom sometimes refers to himself in the third person.
<br><br><br>
<u>Version II</u>
<br><br>
A random benevolence from lonely a phantom,<br>
and a flame hub wielding not only a great club:<br>
thence flows at length a seance's strength.<br>
A radiant ghost greets its might and meets a host.
<br><br>
A sunlight phantom draws in an enduring force,<br>
while he, growing brilliance, refers to aroma of firs.<br>
A writhing of chimes, proclaiming rhymes:<br>
thence flows a crafting of association, warding off damnation.

<summary><b>Quantum Poetry</b></summary>
<p style="text-align: left">
<br>
Pulsations of spontaneous semiotic assertions<br>
are galvanized by intuitive qualia translations.<br>
Organic convexities kiss data input elongations,<br>
as the many correlates that hide betwixt travelled corrugations<br>
are loved by the firstborn of the leptons.
<br><br>
Rigorous seekings for lexical alchemy<br>
are concurrent with flowing creative leniency.<br>
Euclidean channels dance with boson progeny,<br>
as the virtual quill that chisels the crystalline stele<br>
is guided by voyages of an extensive property.

<summary><b>The Marble Muse: An Erotic Poem</b></summary>
<p style="text-align: left">
<br>
A fair Han prostitute who resembles divinity;<br>
state-funded propaganda for reproductive association.<br>
There is a kind of comic dystopia and the gods must be crazy, two.
<br><br>
One does not unwant partaking in rituals of beauty<br>
with faraway land kindred of the priestesses of veneration;<br>
more so when the dark side does not truly cast a shadow unto oneself, too.
<br><br>
A delicious balance in the therapy of the vaporous,<br>
swaying traditional medicine at its finest demonstration,<br>
accompanied by the rhythmic offerings by the muses, to Baimei Shen.
<br><br>
An event that heralds a triumph by thyrsus<br>
based on fundaments that proclaim its harmonious optimization,<br>
expressed in thaumaturgic libations to Aphrodite, which follow then.
