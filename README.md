<h1>About</h1>

<p>
While I am not a software developer, nor other kind of information technology specialist, it behoves me to indicate that I am a supporter of free and open-source software (FOSS). It is due to this advocacy that I use the services I have selected for my static website, for email, for instant messaging (some of them), as well as other functions. 
<br><br>
If you have arrived here from my website's ‘About’ section, you saw a list of FOSS I am familiar with, have used at some point, or have recently started using. As stated there, I did not want to saturate the aside with hyperlinks, since there are both repositories and official websites to consider. Instead, I recommended you to visit my GitHub profile in order to have a look at the platforms and developers I follow, in case you are not acquainted with some of them, and especially if you are less technically savvy and want to increase your general awareness of FOSS options.
