<h1>About</h1>

<p>
My principal purpose for using GitHub is to host <a href= "https://robertoqsx.github.io">one</a> of my static website's <a href="https://app.singlelink.co/u/robertoqs">mirrors</a>, and the first that came into existence (the other one being on Neocities). The other function, not in the least less important, is to follow any users in whose work I am interested, as well as any repositories of platforms and tools I commonly use, have used, or plan on using.
