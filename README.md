<h1>Following FOSS</h1>

<p>
If you have arrived here from my website's ‘<a href="https://robertoqsx.github.io/about.html">About</a>’ section, you saw a list of FOSS I am familiar with, have used at some point, or have recently started using. You can browse them <a href="https://github.com/RobertoQSx?tab=following">here</a>.

<h1>About Me</h1>

A word of appreciation for <a href= "https://github.com/divyaranjan1905">Divya Ranjan</a>'s guidance on HTML and for having introduced me to GitHub Pages and Sourcehut Pages. The CSS featured in my website is <a href= "https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css">Simple.css</a>, by <a href= "https://github.com/kevquirk">Kev Quirk</a>.

While I am not a software developer, nor other kind of information technology specialist, it behoves me to indicate that I am a supporter of FOSS. It is due to this advocacy that I use the services I have selected for my static website, for email, for instant messaging (some of them), as well as other functions. Have a look at the platforms and developers I follow.
